# Unofficial Pytorch re-implementation of Batch normalization free technique for binarized neural network (BNF).
During the inference, BNF simplifies MAC operation of batch normalization (BN) operation to add intergers. We did perform a test comparing with with common binarized neural network (BNN). The result might not be identical. But test accuracy of BNF should be close to same to BNF.

## Results:

## Dependencies:
```
Pytorch >=
```

## Run program:
```python
python main.py
```
